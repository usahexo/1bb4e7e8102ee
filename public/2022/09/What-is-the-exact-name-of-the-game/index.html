<h1 id="What-is-the-story-of-this-game"><a href="#What-is-the-story-of-this-game" class="headerlink" title="What is the story of this game?"></a>What is the story of this game?</h1><p>Assassin’s Creed III tells the story of Desmond Miles, a half-English, half-Native American assassin who takes up the mantle of his ancestor to fight for liberty in eighteenth century America.

<h1 id="Who-created-it"><a href="#Who-created-it" class="headerlink" title="Who created it?"></a>Who created it?</h1><p>The blockchain was originally created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 as a platform for digital currency.

<h1 id="What-is-it"><a href="#What-is-it" class="headerlink" title="What is it?"></a>What is it?</h1><p>The blockchain is a digital ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. It is constantly growing as “completed” blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Bitcoin nodes use the block chain to differentiate legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-it-work"><a href="#How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="How does it work?"></a>How does it work?</h1><p>The blockchain works by allowing bitcoin nodes to agree on the order of transactions. This is done by solving complex mathematical problems that allow new blocks of transactions to be added to the blockchain in a secure way. Bitcoin miners are rewarded with bitcoins for verifying and committing transactions to the blockchain.</p>

This makes the game more immersive and exciting, as you feel like you’re right there in the action.</p>
<p>One of the best FPS games out there is called “Quake III Arena”. It was originally released in 1999, but it’s still popular today thanks to its fast-paced gameplay and addictive multiplayer mode. In Quake III Arena, you battle other players in a variety of different arenas, using a range of weapons and power-ups to take them down. The game is extremely challenging, but also a lot of fun. If you’re looking for a good FPS game to play, Quake III Arena is definitely worth checking out.</p>
