      <h1 id="Record-Tax-Win-for-UK-Gambling-Couple"><a href="#Record-Tax-Win-for-UK-Gambling-Couple" class="headerlink" title="Record Tax Win for UK Gambling Couple"></a>Record Tax Win for UK Gambling Couple</h1><p>The UK gambling couple who won a record £33 million in tax from their winnings have spoken of their relief following the tax victory.</p>
<p>John and Lisa Robson, from Newcastle, scooped the EuroMillions jackpot in May but were told they would have to pay £6.5 million in tax.</p>
<p>However, after taking their case to court, the Robsons have been told they only have to pay £1.7 million.</p>
<p>Speaking after the ruling, Mr Robson said: “It’s a huge relief - it’s been hanging over us for months.”</p>
<p>His wife Lisa added: “We just can’t believe it - it’s like a dream come true.”</p>
<p>The couple said they would now be able to pay off their mortgage and give some money to charity.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for HMRC said: “We are disappointed with the court’s decision and are considering our options.”</p>
<h1 id="1-6M-Tax-Refund-from-Gambling-Win"><a href="#1-6M-Tax-Refund-from-Gambling-Win" class="headerlink" title="$1.6M Tax Refund from Gambling Win"></a>$1.6M Tax Refund from Gambling Win</h1><p>A $1.6 million tax refund from gambling winnings may seem like a dream come true, but it can also create some headaches if not handled correctly. </p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires taxpayers to report all gambling winnings as taxable income. This means that even if you only win a small amount, you will still have to report it on your taxes. And if you happen to hit the jackpot, the taxman will want his share. </p>
<p>In order to avoid any problems with the IRS, it is important to understand and follow the tax laws related to gambling wins. Here are some tips: </p>
<p>-Report all gambling winnings on your tax return. This includes wins from casinos, lotteries, and racetracks, as well as online betting and poker tournaments.</p>
<p>-Gambling losses can be deducted from gambling winnings, but only up to the amount of gambling income reported. So if you report $1,000 in gambling income, you can only deduct $1,000 in losses.</p>
<p>-Make sure to keep accurate records of your gambling activity. This includes receipts for losses and wins, as well as wager tickets and other documentation. If the IRS audits your return and finds that you have not reported all of your gambling income, you could face penalties and interest charges.</p>
<h1 id="Australians-Claim-£5-8M-in-Tax-from-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Australians-Claim-£5-8M-in-Tax-from-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Australians Claim £5.8M in Tax from Gambling Winnings"></a>Australians Claim £5.8M in Tax from Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The ATO (Australian Taxation Office) has announced that Australian taxpayers have claimed almost £6 million in tax deductions from gambling winnings in the 2016-17 financial year. This marks a 12% increase on the previous year, when £5.3 million was claimed.</p>
<p>Most of the claims were made by people who earned less than £100,000, with the average claim being £2,500. The highest single claim was for £380,000.</p>
<p>In a statement, the ATO said that it is “committed to ensuring that all gambling income is reported and taxed correctly”. It added that taxpayers who are unsure about what is taxable and what isn’t should seek advice from a registered tax agent.</p>
<p>The news comes as no surprise to industry insiders, who have long argued that gambling taxes are not high enough. In a submission to the government last year, the Australian Wagering Council (AWC) said that the current tax regime represents “a lost opportunity for increased revenue for government and more responsible wagering behaviour by Australians”.</p>
<p>It proposed that taxation be based on both the amount wagered and the winning amount, with a higher rate applied to jackpots. This would ensure that the tax burden falls more heavily on those who can afford it, while also discouraging people from chasing large payouts.</p>
<p>The government has so far declined to comment on the AWC’s proposal.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Jackpot-Winners-Get-a-Boost-with-Tax-Free-Winnings"><a href="#Casino-Jackpot-Winners-Get-a-Boost-with-Tax-Free-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Casino Jackpot Winners Get a Boost with Tax-Free Winnings"></a>Casino Jackpot Winners Get a Boost with Tax-Free Winnings</h1><p>When casino jackpot winners hit the big one, they often have a lot to celebrate. Not only do they get to revel in their newfound wealth, but they also don’t have to worry about paying any taxes on it. That’s because gambling winnings are tax-free in the United States.</p>
<p>There are a few caveats, though. Winnings that are classified as income, such as from blackjack or poker, are subject to taxation. Winnings that are considered capital gains, such as those from buying and selling stocks or property, are also taxable. Gambling losses can be deducted from gambling winnings when filing your taxes, up to the amount of your winnings.</p>
<p>The tax-free status of gambling winnings is a longstanding tradition in the United States. It began back in the 1930s, when gambling was considered a vice and the government didn’t want people to feel like they were getting dinged on their winnings. The tax-free treatment has stuck around ever since, even as attitudes towards gambling have changed.</p>
<p>It’s not just American citizens who get to enjoy tax-free gambling winnings; visitors to the United States also qualify. So if you happen to be a lucky winner while vacationing in Las Vegas or Atlantic City, you won’t have to worry about coughing up any of your profits to the IRS.</p>
<p>Overall, the tax-free treatment of gambling winnings is a big perk for casino jackpot winners. It means they can keep more of their hard-earned money and use it to enjoy life after hitting it big.</p>
<h1 id="German-Gambler-Wins-Nearly-€2-Million-in-Tax-Free-Winnings"><a href="#German-Gambler-Wins-Nearly-€2-Million-in-Tax-Free-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="German Gambler Wins Nearly €2 Million in Tax-Free Winnings"></a>German Gambler Wins Nearly €2 Million in Tax-Free Winnings</h1><p>50-year-old German gambler Erich S. is the lucky winner of a €1.9 million jackpot at an online casino. What makes this win even more remarkable is that it was completely tax-free, as the winnings were generated from playing in a foreign country.</p>
<p>Germany has some of the tightest gambling laws in Europe, and players are not allowed to win any money from playing in German casinos. However, because Erich’s winnings were generated while playing at an online casino registered in Malta, he was able to keep every penny of his windfall.</p>
<p>Malta is one of the most popular destinations for online gambling, thanks to its favourable regulatory environment and its punchy taxation rates. Players who gamble at Maltese casinos can enjoy tax-free winnings provided that their total gambling losses for the year don’t exceed €5,000. This makes Malta a very attractive destination for high-rollers looking to secure a large tax-free payout.</p>
<p>Erich’s big win comes as a welcome relief after a tough few years financially. He has said that he plans to use the money to pay off his debts and indulge in some long-overdue luxury items.</p>
