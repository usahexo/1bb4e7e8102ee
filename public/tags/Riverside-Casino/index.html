<p>It was a closely fought final table, with Cody eventually coming out on top against American veteran player John Hennigan.</p>
<p>Cody has been one of the most successful young players in the history of poker, having already won two World Series of Poker bracelets and over $4.5 million in tournament winnings.</p>
<p>In a post-match interview, Cody paid tribute to his opponent, saying “John is an all-time great and I’m really happy to have beaten him heads up.”</p>
<p>He also paid tribute to his fans, saying “I really appreciate all the support I’ve been getting recently - it means a lot.”</p>
<p>This latest victory is sure to cement Cody’s place as one of the world’s top poker players. With more titles surely to come, we can expect to see plenty more from this young superstar in years to come.</p>
<h1 id="American-Poker-Star-Jake-Cody-Captures-First-CampoBet-Title"><a href="#American-Poker-Star-Jake-Cody-Captures-First-CampoBet-Title" class="headerlink" title="American Poker Star, Jake Cody, Captures First CampoBet Title!"></a>American Poker Star, Jake Cody, Captures First CampoBet Title!</h1><p>28-year-old British poker pro Jake Cody has turned back the clock to capture his first CampoBet Poker title in Malta, edging out a field of 848 entries to win €102,616.</p>
<p>Cody was one of the last players standing on the final table, eventually defeating Danish player, Allan Baekke heads up to scoop the title and trophy.</p>
<p>The champion started the day as one of the shortest stacks but played some inspired poker to progress further up the standings. On the final table, Cody got his stack in good with ace-queen against pocket eights but failed to improve against Baekkes’ eights full house on a board that ran out ten-high.</p>
<p>A few hands later though, Cody doubled up through Baekke when his ace-king held against Baekkes’ pocket sevens and he never looked back from there.</p>
<p>Final Table Results:</p>
<h1 id="Young-UK-Poker-Player-Jake-Cody-Wins-at-CampoBet"><a href="#Young-UK-Poker-Player-Jake-Cody-Wins-at-CampoBet" class="headerlink" title="Young UK Poker Player Jake Cody Wins at CampoBet"></a>Young UK Poker Player Jake Cody Wins at CampoBet</h1><p>22-year old Jake Cody from the United Kingdom has won a €11,000 tournament at CampoBet. This is his third big win in as many months!</p>
<p>Cody is a professional poker player who turned to gambling at the ripe age of 18. He started out playing online poker and Mega Fortune Dreams slot machines, before progressing onto blackjack, roulette and finally classic casino table games.</p>
<p>It was in late 2017 that he began to make a name for himself by winning a number of tournaments both live and online. In January 2018, he won €33,000 at the Pokerstars Caribbean Adventure (PCA) tournament in the Bahamas. Only a month later, he scooped up another €11,000 win at the CampoBet Easter tourney.</p>
<p>What makes Jake Cody’s story so remarkable is that he is still very young and has plenty of time to continue his successes in the gambling world. Roulette and blackjack are not typically thought of as young man’s games, but with Cody’s talent for them, anything seems possible!</p>
<p>In an interview with Totally Gaming after his PCA win, Cody said: “I love playing live tournaments - there’s nothing like the feeling of sitting down at a table and taking on your opponents. The competition is really tough but that just makes it all the more satisfying when you come out on top. I’ve been working hard on my game recently and it seems to be paying off - hopefully I can keep this run going!”</p>
<h1 id="Jake-Cody-wins-CampoBet-Main-Event"><a href="#Jake-Cody-wins-CampoBet-Main-Event" class="headerlink" title="Jake Cody wins CampoBet Main Event"></a>Jake Cody wins CampoBet Main Event</h1><p>Jake Cody secured his second CampoBet Main Event title in as many years on Sunday, outlasting a field of 527 entries to win the €232,000 first-place prize.</p>
<p>Cody began the final day as one of the shortest stacks in the room, but he slowly chipped away at his opponents until he found himself heads-up against Pawel Brzeski.</p>
<p>Brzeski started the final table as the chip leader and was looking to win his first major title, but Cody was not going to let that happen. After a long battle, Cody finally dispatched of Brzeski to take down the trophy and the €232,000 first-place prize.</p>
<p>“I’m so happy. It feels amazing to win this tournament again,” said Cody after his victory. “I came into the final table short-stacked and I just managed to grind my way back up. I’m super proud of myself for doing that.”</p>
<p>The CampoBet Main Event saw some big names make deep runs, with Fedor Holz finishing in fourth place and Dominik Nitsche finishing in sixth place. But it was Jake Cody who emerged victorious in the end.</p>
<p>This marks Jake Cody’s third major title win, following victories in both the European Poker Tour Grand Final and the World Series of Poker Europe Main Event in 2012. He is now firmly established as one of the best poker players in the world.</p>
<h1 id="British-Poker-Sensation-Jake-Cody-Wins-CampoBet-Championship"><a href="#British-Poker-Sensation-Jake-Cody-Wins-CampoBet-Championship" class="headerlink" title="British Poker Sensation, Jake Cody, Wins CampoBet Championship"></a>British Poker Sensation, Jake Cody, Wins CampoBet Championship</h1><p>24-year-old British poker sensation, Jake Cody, won the CampoBet Championship in Montenegro on Sunday 5th of November, taking home a staggering €265,000 in prize money.</p>
<p>Cody’s victory was all the more impressive given that he was up against some of the biggest names in poker, including last year’s world champion, Martin Kabrhel.</p>
<p>Commenting after his win, Cody said: “It feels amazing to have finally won a big tournament. I’ve come close a few times but never quite got there. To do it now against such a high calibre of players is really satisfying.”</p>
<p>Cody began his professional poker career in 2009 at the age of 18 and has already amassed over $3 million in career earnings. In 2015 he won two World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets - one in the $10,000 six-handed No Limit Hold’em event and one in the $25,000 Pot Limit Omaha Hi-Lo 8 event.</p>
<p>He becomes only the second player to have won bracelets in both No Limit Hold’em and Pot Limit Omaha events and is currently ranked number three on Britain’s all-time money list behind only Chris Moorman and Sam Trickett.</p>
