<p>It was a closely fought final table, with Cody eventually coming out on top against American veteran player John Hennigan.</p>
<p>Cody has been one of the most successful young players in the history of poker, having already won two World Series of Poker bracelets and over $4.5 million in tournament winnings.</p>
<p>In a post-match interview, Cody paid tribute to his opponent, saying “John is an all-time great and I’m really happy to have beaten him heads up.”</p>
<p>He also paid tribute to his fans, saying “I really appreciate all the support I’ve been getting recently - it means a lot.”</p>
<p>This latest victory is sure to cement Cody’s place as one of the world’s top poker players. With more titles surely to come, we can expect to see plenty more from this young superstar in years to come.</p>
<h1 id="American-Poker-Star-Jake-Cody-Captures-First-CampoBet-Title"><a href="#American-Poker-Star-Jake-Cody-Captures-First-CampoBet-Title" class="headerlink" title="American Poker Star, Jake Cody, Captures First CampoBet Title!"></a>American Poker Star, Jake Cody, Captures First CampoBet Title!</h1><p>28-year-old British poker pro Jake Cody has turned back the clock to capture his first CampoBet Poker title in Malta, edging out a field of 848 entries to win €102,616.</p>
<p>Cody was one of the last players standing on the final table, eventually defeating Danish player, Allan Baekke heads up to scoop the title and trophy.</p>
<p>The champion started the day as one of the shortest stacks but played some inspired poker to progress further up the standings. On the final table, Cody got his stack in good with ace-queen against pocket eights but failed to improve against Baekkes’ eights full house on a board that ran out ten-high.</p>
<p>A few hands later though, Cody doubled up through Baekke when his ace-king held against Baekkes’ pocket sevens and he never looked back from there.</p>
<p>Final Table Results:</p>
<h1 id="Young-UK-Poker-Player-Jake-Cody-Wins-at-CampoBet"><a href="#Young-UK-Poker-Player-Jake-Cody-Wins-at-CampoBet" class="headerlink" title="Young UK Poker Player Jake Cody Wins at CampoBet"></a>Young UK Poker Player Jake Cody Wins at CampoBet</h1><p>22-year old Jake Cody from the United Kingdom has won a €11,000 tournament at CampoBet. This is his third big win in as many months!</p>
<p>Cody is a professional poker player who turned to gambling at the ripe age of 18. He started out playing online poker and Mega Fortune Dreams slot machines, before progressing onto blackjack, roulette and finally classic casino table games.</p>
<p>It was in late 2017 that he began to make a name for himself by winning a number of tournaments both live and online. In January 2018, he won €33,000 at the Pokerstars Caribbean Adventure (PCA) tournament in the Bahamas. Only a month later, he scooped up another €11,000 win at the CampoBet Easter tourney.</p>
<p>What makes Jake Cody’s story so remarkable is that he is still very young and has plenty of time to continue his successes in the gambling world. Roulette and blackjack are not typically thought of as young man’s games, but with Cody’s talent for them, anything seems possible!</p>
<p>In an interview with Totally Gaming after his PCA win, Cody said: “I love playing live tournaments - there’s nothing like the feeling of sitting down at a table and taking on your opponents. The competition is really tough but that just makes it all the more satisfying when you come out on top. I’ve been working hard on my game recently and it seems to be paying off - hopefully I can keep this run going!”</p>
<h1 id="Jake-Cody-wins-CampoBet-Main-Event"><a href="#Jake-Cody-wins-CampoBet-Main-Event" class="headerlink" title="Jake Cody wins CampoBet Main Event"></a>Jake Cody wins CampoBet Main Event</h1><p>Jake Cody secured his second CampoBet Main Event title in as many years on Sunday, outlasting a field of 527 entries to win the €232,000 first-place prize.</p>
<p>Cody began the final day as one of the shortest stacks in the room, but he slowly chipped away at his opponents until he found himself heads-up against Pawel Brzeski.</p>
<p>Brzeski started the final table as the chip leader and was looking to win his first major title, but Cody was not going to let that happen. After a long battle, Cody finally dispatched of Brzeski to take down the trophy and the €232,000 first-place prize.</p>
<p>“I’m so happy. It feels amazing to win this tournament again,” said Cody after his victory. “I came into the final table short-stacked and I just managed to grind my way back up. I’m super proud of myself for doing that.”</p>
<p>The CampoBet Main Event saw some big names make deep runs, with Fedor Holz finishing in fourth place and Dominik Nitsche finishing in sixth place. But it was Jake Cody who emerged victorious in the end.</p>
<p>This marks Jake Cody’s third major title win, following victories in both the European Poker Tour Grand Final and the World Series of Poker Europe Main Event in 2012. He is now firmly established as one of the best poker players in the world.</p>
<h1 id="British-Poker-Sensation-Jake-Cody-Wins-CampoBet-Championship"><a href="#British-Poker-Sensation-Jake-Cody-Wins-CampoBet-Championship" class="headerlink" title="British Poker Sensation, Jake Cody, Wins CampoBet Championship"></a>British Poker Sensation, Jake Cody, Wins CampoBet Championship</h1><p>24-year-old British poker sensation, Jake Cody, won the CampoBet Championship in Montenegro on Sunday 5th of November, taking home a staggering €265,000 in prize money.</p>
<p>Cody’s victory was all the more impressive given that he was up against some of the biggest names in poker, including last year’s world champion, Martin Kabrhel.</p>
<p>Commenting after his win, Cody said: “It feels amazing to have finally won a big tournament. I’ve come close a few times but never quite got there. To do it now against such a high calibre of players is really satisfying.”</p>
<p>Cody began his professional poker career in 2009 at the age of 18 and has already amassed over $3 million in career earnings. In 2015 he won two World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets - one in the $10,000 six-handed No Limit Hold’em event and one in the $25,000 Pot Limit Omaha Hi-Lo 8 event.</p>
<p>He becomes only the second player to have won bracelets in both No Limit Hold’em and Pot Limit Omaha events and is currently ranked number three on Britain’s all-time money list behind only Chris Moorman and Sam Trickett.</p>

        <h1 id="California-Texas-and-Florida-Lose-Out-on-Tax-Free-Bingo"><a href="#California-Texas-and-Florida-Lose-Out-on-Tax-Free-Bingo" class="headerlink" title="California, Texas, and Florida Lose Out on Tax Free Bingo"></a>California, Texas, and Florida Lose Out on Tax Free Bingo</h1><p>As of October 1, 2019, tax-free bingo is no longer available in California, Texas, or Florida. This change was made as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which limited the availability of state and local tax deductions. The Act specifically prohibited taxpayers from deducting any amount paid or incurred for bingo games.</p>
<p>Bingo has been around since the 1500s, when it was used to raise money for religious ceremonies. In the early 20th century, it became popular as a way to raise money for social causes. Today, it is often used to raise money for charity events.</p>
<p>Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, taxpayers could deduct up to $100 per game of bingo played in a charitable event. This deduction was available regardless of whether the taxpayer won or lost money playing bingo. As a result of the Act, taxpayers can no longer deduct any amount paid or incurred for bingo games.</p>
<p>The changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 are estimated to raise $2 billion over 10 years.</p>
<h1 id="California’s-Loss-of-Tax-Free-Bingo-Could-Mean-Millions-in-Revenue"><a href="#California’s-Loss-of-Tax-Free-Bingo-Could-Mean-Millions-in-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="California’s Loss of Tax-Free Bingo Could Mean Millions in Revenue"></a>California’s Loss of Tax-Free Bingo Could Mean Millions in Revenue</h1><p>A recent proposal in the state of California to tax bingo games could mean lost revenue for the state. According to a study by the California Legislative Analyst’s Office, taxing bingo games could bring in as much as $10 million in additional revenue for the state each year.</p>
<p>Currently, bingo games are exempt from state and local taxes, but Assembly Bill 298 would change that. The bill was introduced by Assemblyman Richard Bloom (D-Santa Monica) in February and is currently making its way through the legislature.</p>
<p>If passed, the bill would impose a tax of 10 percent on all winnings from bingo games. The money raised would be used to support arts and cultural programs in California.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill say it will lead to less participation in bingo games and result in less revenue for the state. They argue that the people who play bingo are predominantly seniors and that they can’t afford to pay an additional 10 percent on their winnings.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that even if there is a decrease in participation, the tax would still generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state each year. They argue that it’s time to reevaluate how gambling is taxed in California and that the money raised could be used to support important programs like arts and culture.</p>
<p>The fate of Assembly Bill 298 is still undecided, but the debate over whether or not to tax bingo games is sure to continue.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-Loses-100-Million-a-Year-in-Tax-Free-Bingo-Revenue"><a href="#Texas-Loses-100-Million-a-Year-in-Tax-Free-Bingo-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Texas Loses $100 Million a Year in Tax-Free Bingo Revenue"></a>Texas Loses $100 Million a Year in Tax-Free Bingo Revenue</h1><p>Texas is missing out on an estimated $100 million in tax revenue each year from bingo halls, according to a new report from the state comptroller’s office.</p>
<p>The state currently does not tax any type of bingo game, whether it is played in a hall or online. In the fiscal year 2017, the comptroller’s office estimates that Texas lost out on more than $100 million in revenue from bingo games.</p>
<p>That number is only expected to grow as online bingo becomes more popular. In states like New York and Illinois, online bingo generates millions of dollars in tax revenue each year.</p>
<p>“This is money that we are not collecting for education, health care and other important services,” said State Comptroller Glenn Hegar. “It is long past time for the state of Texas to start taxing this activity.”</p>
<p>Hegar has proposed legislation that would levy a flat tax of 10 percent on all bingo winnings, regardless of the game’s format. The proposal has been approved by the Joint Committee on Revenue and sent to the full Texas Senate for consideration.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill say it could hurt mom-and-pop bingo halls around the state. Hegar says he is open to tweaking the bill to help those halls, but he believes they can still compete if they offer better promotions and amenities.</p>
<p>Even with Hegar’s proposed tax increase, Texas would still have one of the lowest tax rates on bingo in the country.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-Loses-Over-300-Million-in-Revenue-from-Tax-Free-Bingo"><a href="#Florida-Loses-Over-300-Million-in-Revenue-from-Tax-Free-Bingo" class="headerlink" title="Florida Loses Over $300 Million in Revenue from Tax-Free Bingo"></a>Florida Loses Over $300 Million in Revenue from Tax-Free Bingo</h1><p>The state of Florida has lost an estimated $301.5 million in revenue from tax-free bingo during the past five years, according to a recent study by the Florida Legislature’s Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA). OPPAGA found that, while other forms of gambling are taxed at a rate of 35 percent, bingo is exempt from state and local taxes.</p>
<p>The study also found that the amount of money wagered on bingo has increased significantly in recent years, from $559.7 million in fiscal year 2013-14 to $674.1 million in fiscal year 2016-17. Despite this increase, the state has seen a corresponding decrease in revenue generated from bingo taxes, which totaled just $2.8 million during fiscal year 2016-17.</p>
<p>State Representative Cord Byrd (R-Jacksonville) recently filed a bill that would tax bingo at 5 percent, which he estimates would generate an additional $3 million in revenue annually. “It’s time for Florida to get its fair share from this growing industry,” said Rep. Byrd. “Bingo is a big business in our state and it’s time we start treating it like one.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it would hurt smaller charities that rely on bingo proceeds to support their activities. However, Rep. Byrd notes that his bill includes a provision that would allow smaller charities to continue to operate tax-free provided they meet certain requirements.</p>
<p>If approved, Rep. Byrd’s bill would mark the first time that bingo has been taxed in Florida since it was made exempt from taxes in 1978.</p>
<h1 id="States-Without-Tax-Free-Bingo-Left-at-a-Disadvantage"><a href="#States-Without-Tax-Free-Bingo-Left-at-a-Disadvantage" class="headerlink" title="States Without Tax-Free Bingo Left at a Disadvantage"></a>States Without Tax-Free Bingo Left at a Disadvantage</h1><p>Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Oklahoma are the only states without tax-free bingo halls. This places these states at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting tourists and generating revenue.</p>
<p>Bingo is a popular game enjoyed by people of all ages and income levels. It is enjoyed for its social aspects as well as the opportunity to win money. In order to attract tourists and generate revenue, many states offer tax-free bingo. This means that the players do not have to pay any taxes on their winnings.</p>
<p>The states without tax-free bingo are at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting tourists and generating revenue. Tax-free bingo halls offer an opportunity for players to enjoy the game and potentially win money without having to pay taxes. This can be a draw for tourists who are looking for ways to save money on their vacation. Additionally, tax-free bingo can help generate revenue for the state by bringing in players who would not normally visit the state.</p>
<p>States without tax-free bingo should consider implementing this policy in order to attract tourists and generate revenue. Offering tax-free bingo can help these states compete with others in terms of tourism and revenue generation.</p>

However, if you know how to play bingo at a casino like a pro, you can walk away with some serious wins!</p>
<p>Here are some tips to help you get started:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Do your research. Just like any other game at the casino, it’s important to do your research on bingo before playing. Know the different types of bingo games that are offered and understand the rules of each one. This way, you’ll be able to make informed decisions about which games to play and how much money to wager.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use your bonuses wisely. Most casinos offer sign-up bonuses for new players, and these can be a great way to increase your bankroll when playing bingo. Be sure to look for bonuses that offer free spins on bingo games or matching deposits up to a certain amount.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose. Even though bingo can be a profitable game if played correctly, it’s still important to remember that it’s a gamble and you could end up losing money. Always gamble within your means so that you don’t end up going overboard and ruining your financial stability.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make use of chat features. Many online casinos offer chat features that allow players to communicate with each other during games. This can be a great way to learn from other players and get insights on upcoming numbers. It can also be helpful for making friends in the online gambling community!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay disciplined. One of the biggest challenges when playing any type of casino game is staying disciplined. Bingo is no exception! Be sure not to spend more money than you intended or chase after lost bets – this can lead to disastrous outcomes quickly. Stick to a budget and only bet what you feel comfortable losing and you should be fine.</p>

<p>The game begins when the caller draws out the first ball and calls out its number. Players then mark that number on their cards with a pen or a marker. The game pauses after the caller draws out each ball and announces its number, giving players time to mark their cards.</p>
<p>The object of the game is to be the first player to form a specified pattern on their card with the drawn balls. This could be anything from a single row of five squares, to a full house comprising of all 25 squares on the card. The winning player typically yells “Bingo!” to notify all other players that they have won and to claim their prize.</p>
<p>If you’re planning on playing bingo in a casino, there are some things you need to know first. Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learn the different patterns that can be formed on a bingo card, as well as the associated prizes. This will help you make decisions about where to place your bets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bring plenty of cash, as not all casinos accept credit or debit cards for bingo games.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know when the games start and end. This will help you plan your visit accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be aware of the bet minimums and maximums for each game. This will help you determine how much money you want to bring with you to the casino.</p>
</li>
</ul>

The sights, sounds, and thrill of the games can be a lot of fun. However, if you want to get the most out of your experience, it’s important to know what to do and what not to do. Here are some tips from Apollo Gaming on how to make the most of your casino viewing experience:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Plan ahead. Know what games you want to play and how much money you want to spend before you arrive at the casino. This will help keep you from making impulse decisions that can lead to costly mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Drink in moderation. While having a drink or two may help take the edge off, drinking too much can cloud your judgement and lead to bad decisions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>gamble responsibly. Don’t gamble more than you can afford to lose. Remember, gambling is a form of entertainment, not an investment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>dress for success. Dress appropriately for a casino setting. This means no shorts, tank tops, or other revealing clothing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>be aware of your surroundings. Watch out for people who may be trying to take advantage of you. If something doesn’t seem right, trust your instincts and leave the area.</p>
</li>
<li><p>have fun! The most important thing is to enjoy yourself while you’re at the casino. Take time to relax and have some fun!</p>
</li>
</ol>
