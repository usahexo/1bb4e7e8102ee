        <h1 id="Turkish-Telecoms-Admits-To-Cooking-The-Books"><a href="#Turkish-Telecoms-Admits-To-Cooking-The-Books" class="headerlink" title="Turkish Telecoms Admits To Cooking The Books"></a>Turkish Telecoms Admits To Cooking The Books</h1><p>In a move that has surprised many, the telecoms regulator in Turkey has admitted to artificially inflating the number of subscribers on the Turkish telecommunications network. The revelation came as a result of an investigation by the regulator into allegations of fraud by the operators.</p>
<p>The admission is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the telecoms sector in Turkey, with regulators now vowing to crack down on the practice and recover any losses suffered as a result of it. It is also likely to put pressure on the government to act, with politicians already calling for those responsible to be held to account.</p>
<p>The inflated subscriber numbers have been used by the telecoms operators to justify high prices and tariffs, which consumers have long complained about. Now that it has emerged that many of these subscribers do not actually exist, there is likely to be a renewed push for price cuts and regulatory reform.</p>
<p>The scandal is another blow for Turkey’s telecoms sector, which was rocked last year by revelations that phone companies were illegally wiretapping their customers’ conversations.</p>
<h1 id="Turk-Telekom-Fined-Over-€500-000-For-Cooking-The-Books"><a href="#Turk-Telekom-Fined-Over-€500-000-For-Cooking-The-Books" class="headerlink" title="Turk Telekom Fined Over €500,000 For Cooking The Books"></a>Turk Telekom Fined Over €500,000 For Cooking The Books</h1><p>Turk Telekom, the largest telecommunications company in Turkey, has been fined over €500,000 by the country’s capital markets watchdog for cooking its books.</p>
<p>The Capital Markets Board (CMB) said that Turk Telekom had inflated its profits by around TL800 million ($281 million) between 2007 and 2010. This artificially inflated profit allowed the company to pay out dividends totaling TL2.8 billion during the period, when it should have paid out just TL2.0 billion.</p>
<p>As a result of the CMB’s findings, Turk Telekom has agreed to pay a fine of TL494 million, which is equivalent to 5% of its net profit for 2010. The company will also be required to revise its financial statements for 2007-2010 and restate its dividend payments for those years.</p>
<p>In a statement released on Wednesday, Turk Telekom said it accepted the findings of the CMB’s investigation and would take all necessary measures to comply with their recommendations.</p>

<p>The company was accused of remotely deleting books from the servers of Turkish internet providers, in a case brought by the human rights group Amnesty International.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom said it had complied with a request from the Turkish government to block access to a website that included content considered illegal in Turkey.</p>
<p>But the court ruled that the telecoms giant should have ensured that only the specific website was blocked, and not other websites that also happened to be hosted on the same servers.</p>
<h1 id="Spanish-Hacking-Inquiry-Links-Turkish-Telecoms-To-€15-Million-Book-Cooking-Scheme"><a href="#Spanish-Hacking-Inquiry-Links-Turkish-Telecoms-To-€15-Million-Book-Cooking-Scheme" class="headerlink" title="Spanish Hacking Inquiry Links Turkish Telecoms To €15 Million Book-Cooking Scheme"></a>Spanish Hacking Inquiry Links Turkish Telecoms To €15 Million Book-Cooking Scheme</h1><p>Prosecutors in Barcelona have alleged that executives at a Turkish telecommunications company participated in a €15 million ($17 million) scheme to cook the company’s books. The corruption investigation, which has also implicated senior officials in the Spanish government, has raised fresh concerns about the extent of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s control over his country’s economy.</p>
<p>The fraud conspiracy, which was detailed in a complaint filed by prosecutors on Wednesday, involved falsifying invoices sent by a Turkish telecommunications provider to its Spanish counterpart. The false documents were allegedly used to justify the transfer of millions of euros from the Spanish company to its Turkish counterpart.</p>
<p>According to prosecutors, the scheme was orchestrated by managers at Turk Telekom, Turkey’s largest telecommunications company. They allege that the company falsified invoices worth almost €15 million between 2010 and 2012. The money was then transferred to companies controlled by allies of Erdogan, including his son-in-law Berat Albayrak.</p>
<p>In addition to Turk Telekom, executives at two other Turkish telecommunications providers are also believed to be implicated in the fraud. Alpay Ovacik and Sefa Sadik Aygin, both former executives at Turkcell, are accused of helping disguise the true nature of the transactions.</p>
<p>The allegations of corruption have added to concerns about Erdogan’s increasingly authoritarian rule and its impact on Turkey’s economy. The Turkish president has been accused of consolidating power by cracking down on dissent and purging opposition leaders from key government ministries and agencies.</p>
<p>Erdogan has also been criticized for his handling of Turkey’s economy, which has suffered as a result of his aggressive policies. In recent months, the value of the Turkish lira has plummeted amid concerns about high levels of debt and inflation.</p>
<h1 id="Lebanese-Bank-Financing-Turkish-Telecoms-In-€15-Million-Book-Cooking-Scheme"><a href="#Lebanese-Bank-Financing-Turkish-Telecoms-In-€15-Million-Book-Cooking-Scheme" class="headerlink" title="Lebanese Bank Financing Turkish Telecoms In €15 Million Book-Cooking Scheme"></a>Lebanese Bank Financing Turkish Telecoms In €15 Million Book-Cooking Scheme</h1><p>According to sources in Beirut, a group of Lebanese banks have financed Turkish telecoms company Turkcell in a scheme worth €15 million. The banks are said to have provided the financingthrough a special purpose vehicle (SPV) set up for the deal.</p>
<p>The move is raising eyebrows in the Lebanese banking community, as it is the first time that local banks have financed Turkcell. The telecoms company has been blacklisted by the United States and other Western countries due to its close ties to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.</p>
<p>It is not clear why the Lebanese banks decided to finance Turkcell, or what they will receive in return. Some bankers suggest that the banks may be looking for preferential treatment from Turkcell in future negotiations over mobile licenses in Lebanon. Others believe that the banks may have been misled by their lawyers into thinking that the deal was more innocuous than it is.</p>
<p>One banker involved in the transaction told us: “This could end up being a very costly mistake for the Lebanese banking sector. We’re not sure what we were thinking when we agreed to finance Turkcell – it seems like a very risky investment indeed.”</p>
