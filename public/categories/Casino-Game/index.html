Nevertheless, who’s the richest one? The answer to that question could shock you.</p>
<p>It’s not an American or a European. It’s not even somebody who performs within the World Sequence of Poker (WSOP) Main Event. As a substitute, the richest poker participant on this planet is from Asia and he doesn’t even play within the public eye as a lot as some of his counterparts.</p>
<p>His title is Jay Chou and he’s a Taiwanese singer, actor, and businessman. In accordance with Forbes, Chou has a internet worth of $8 billion making him the richest musician on this planet and the sixth richest individual in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Whereas Chou doesn’t often play in large-scale live tournaments, he has confirmed himself to be a big-time winner in particular person video games. In 2014, Chou gained an unbelievable $28 million from an evening poker recreation in Manila!</p>
<p>So what’s driving Jay Chou’s monumental wealth? Principally, it comes from his various business pursuits. He owns stakes in quite a few firms which have generated hundreds of millions of dollars in income. These corporations embrace PepsiCo Taiwan, Marvel Studios, Lotus Hotel Taipei, and WiLAN Inc.</p>
<p>What would make you even richer than Jay Chou? Properly, presumably winning one other $28 million poker recreation!</p>

<p>English Premier League sides Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur round out the top four, with both clubs having a combined wealth of over $1billion.</p>
<p>Italian side Juventus are fifth on the list, with a combined wealth of over $900million, while Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona come in sixth and seventh respectively, with a combined wealth of just under $900million each.</p>

<h1 id="Which-poker-player-is-the-richest-in-the-world-Olympique-De-Marseille"><a href="#Which-poker-player-is-the-richest-in-the-world-Olympique-De-Marseille" class="headerlink" title="Which poker player is the richest in the world Olympique De Marseille?"></a>Which poker player is the richest in the world Olympique De Marseille?</h1><p>As of 2019, the richest poker player in the world is not Phil Ivey or Antonio Esfandiari. It is actually French professional poker player Bertrand Grospellier, also known as ElkY. As of 2019, his net worth is estimated at $35 million.</p>
<p>ElkY was born in October 1978 in Rouen, France. He began playing poker in 2002 and quickly rose to fame on the European poker scene. In 2005, he won his first major international title at the PokerStars European Poker Championships (EPT). He followed that up by winning the WPT Vienna Open in 2006.</p>
<p>2007 was ElkY’s breakout year. He won two World Series of Poker gold bracelets - one in the $5,000 No Limit Hold’em Shootout and one in the $10,000 Omaha Hi&#x2F;Lo Split-8 or Better Championship. He also won two EPT titles - the EPT Monte Carlo Grand Final and the EPT Barcelona Open. In total, ElkY earned more than $2 million in prize money during 2007 alone.</p>
<p>Since then, ElkY has continued to be one of the most successful players in the world. He has won dozens of major tournaments and has earned millions of dollars in prize money. In addition to his poker career, ElkY has also had success as a professional video game player, winning several championships in popular games such as Street Fighter and StarCraft II.</p>
<p>So why is ElkY so successful at poker? His secret seems to be his versatile skillset. He is equally comfortable playing no limit Hold’em cash games or high stakes tournaments. He is also a very aggressive player who isn’t afraid to go all-in with big bets. This style can often be unpredictable and frustrating for opponents to deal with.</p>
<p>In addition to his skills at the table, ElkY is also a very shrewd businessman outside of poker. For example, he has a sponsorship deal with online gaming company PokerStars which pays him tens of thousands of dollars every year. He has also been involved in several other business ventures over the years, including a clothing line and an online poker training site.</p>
<p>At 39 years old, ElkY shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. He continues to be one of the top players in the world and shows no signs of retiring any time soon. With such a successful career behind him already, it will be interesting to see how much further he can climb up the rankings</p>

He is an anonymous player who has never revealed his identity. In 2015, he won a tournament at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas for $1.8 million. This was the largest single payout ever won by a Marseille poker player.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-money-has-Olympique-De-Marseille’s-top-poker-player-earned"><a href="#How-much-money-has-Olympique-De-Marseille’s-top-poker-player-earned" class="headerlink" title="How much money has Olympique De Marseille’s top poker player earned?"></a>How much money has Olympique De Marseille’s top poker player earned?</h1><p>Team PokerStars Pro Bertrand “Elky” Grospellier is a professional poker player from France who has enjoyed success in both live and online tournaments.
