#  American Poker Star, Jake Cody, Captures First CampoBet Title!

28-year-old British poker pro Jake Cody has turned back the clock to capture his first CampoBet Poker title in Malta, edging out a field of 848 entries to win €102,616.

Cody was one of the last players standing on the final table, eventually defeating Danish player, Allan Baekke heads up to scoop the title and trophy.

The champion started the day as one of the shortest stacks but played some inspired poker to progress further up the standings. On the final table, Cody got his stack in good with ace-queen against pocket eights but failed to improve against Baekkes’ eights full house on a board that ran out ten-high.

A few hands later though, Cody doubled up through Baekke when his ace-king held against Baekkes’ pocket sevens and he never looked back from there.

#  Young UK Poker Player Jake Cody Wins at CampoBet

22-year old Jake Cody from the United Kingdom has won a €11,000 tournament at CampoBet. This is his third big win in as many months!

Cody is a professional poker player who turned to gambling at the ripe age of 18. He started out playing online poker and Mega Fortune Dreams slot machines, before progressing onto blackjack, roulette and finally classic casino table games.

It was in late 2017 that he began to make a name for himself by winning a number of tournaments both live and online. In January 2018, he won €33,000 at the Pokerstars Caribbean Adventure (PCA) tournament in the Bahamas. Only a month later, he scooped up another €11,000 win at the CampoBet Easter tourney.

What makes Jake Cody’s story so remarkable is that he is still very young and has plenty of time to continue his successes in the gambling world. Roulette and blackjack are not typically thought of as young man’s games, but with Cody’s talent for them, anything seems possible!

In an interview with Totally Gaming after his PCA win, Cody said: “I love playing live tournaments - there’s nothing like the feeling of sitting down at a table and taking on your opponents. The competition is really tough but that just makes it all the more satisfying when you come out on top. I’ve been working hard on my game recently and it seems to be paying off - hopefully I can keep this run going!”
