#   Playing Brotherhood Blackjack Online 

 Brotherhood Blackjack is a variant of the game that is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. The game is played between two players, one playing against the house, and the other playing against the first player. The game can be played for fun or for money.

The aim of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over, or by having a higher total than the dealer. Cards values are as follows: Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, 2-10 are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are all worth 10 points.

After both players have placed their bets, one card is dealt face up to each player and one card is dealt face down to the dealer. The face down card to the dealer is called the ‘hole’ card. Players then take turns in drawing further cards from the pack until they either decide to stand (stick with what they have) or go over 21 points and bust. The dealer must also hit on 16 or below and stand on 17 or above.

The player with the highest total (or who has not busted if both players have the same total) wins the hand. If you beat the dealers hand without going over 21 then you receive double your stake back (a winning blackjack pays 3:2). If you lose to the dealer then you lose your bet amount.

  So now that you know how to play Brotherhood Blackjack it's time to learn about some of the different rules that can affect your chances of winning! 

Firstly there is Insurance which can be taken when the dealers first card is an Ace (or any 10 valued card). This insurance costs half of your original bet and pays out at 2:1 if the dealers second card is any value other than 10 (which would make their hand blackjack). 
It's important to remember though that even if you take insurance you can still lose overall if your hand beats the dealers but not by enough to cover both your original bet and insurance payment! 

Secondly there's Splitting which allows you to split your hand into two separate hands when you are dealt two cards of equal rank (e.g two 8s). When splitting, both hands are then played independently and each receives an additional card. If either hand subsequently exceeds 21 then that hand is bust and automatically loses regardless of what the other hand achieves. You can only Split once per hand and cannot Split Aces (unless specifically stated by casino rules). 
Thirdly there's Doubling Down which allows you to double your bet amount in exchange for just one more card being dealt to your existing hand. You should only Double Down if you think there's a good chance of improving your total with that extra card - for instance if you're holding an Ace and a 9 then doubling down gives you a better chance of getting close to 21 without going bust! 
Fourthly there's Surrender which gives players an option to give up half their bet amount in exchange for ending their current hand immediately - regardless of whether they've won or lost so far! This rule only applies in certain situations so check with casino staff before surrendering if it's not explicitly mentioned in casino rules. 

So now that we know all about Brother Blackjack variations - why not try out a few games online? Most online casinos offer free play options so you can try out new variants without risking any real money - perfect for those times when you're feeling lucky!
