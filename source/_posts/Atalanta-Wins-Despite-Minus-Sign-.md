#  Atalanta Wins Despite Minus Sign 

ATLANTA, Ga. – The Atlanta Falcons’ season ended Sunday in the divisional playoffs, despite playing with a minus-three turnover differential.

Atlanta entered Sunday’s game against the Philadelphia Eagles as a 3.5-point home underdog, but pulled off the upset victory, 15-10. Eagles quarterback Nick Foles was held to just 246 yards on 26-of-43 passing and one touchdown, with two costly interceptions.

The Falcons were led by running back Devonta Freeman, who rushed for 98 yards on 21 carries and caught five passes for an additional 44 yards. Atlanta’s defense also came up big, sacking Foles four times and holding Philadelphia to just 281 total yards on offense.

It was a triumphant end to a tumultuous season for Atlanta, which saw starting quarterback Matt Ryan miss time with a concussion and middle linebacker Deion Jones diagnosed with a foot injury that is expected to require surgery. The Falcons will now await their opponent in the NFC Championship Game, which will be determined after Monday night’s game between the Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints.

#  Late Penalty Saves Atalanta, plusminus still earns payout 

In a matchup of two sides vying for a spot in European competition, Atalanta faced off against Inter Milan. The stakes were high, as the winner would take fourth place and the berth in the UEFA Europa League it brings, while the loser would have to compete in qualifying. Late drama ensued, as Mauro Icardi equalized for Inter in stoppage time to send the match to extra time. However, seven minutes into first-half extra time, Josip Ilicic converted from the penalty spot to give Atalanta the lead. Inter pushed for an equalizer but couldn’t find one, and Atalanta held on for the win.

The victory was a big one for Atalanta; not only did they take fourth place and earn their spot in the UEFA Europa League, but they also eliminated Inter Milan from contention. The result was also a boon to plusminus players who backed Atalanta, as they earned a payout despite the late equalizer.

When it comes to gambling on soccer matches, there are a variety of factors one needs to consider. In addition to picking winning teams, one also needs to pay attention to things like goal difference and whether or not a match is going to go into extra time or not. This is where plusminus comes into play; by taking into account which teams are likely to score more goals (and therefore earn a higher payout), bettors can increase their chances of winning.

For this particular matchup, Atalanta was the heavy favorite; with Inter Milan playing out of form and having already qualified for Europe via their league position, it was no surprise that Atlana was installed as -250 favorites (meaning bettors would need to wager $250 to win $100). However, with Icardi scoring in stoppage time, some people may have been tempted to cash out at that point and avoid any potential losses.

For those who stuck with it and bet on Atlantna at -275 odds (meaning you would need to wager $275 to win $100), they were rewarded when Ilicic converted from the penalty spot early in extra time. This gave Atlantna the win and moved them up into fourth place in Serie A, while eliminating Inter Milan from European competition altogether.

While some may feel that betting on soccer is a fool’s errand due to all of the variables that come into play, with good research it is possible to make informed decisions that can lead to profits. By looking at matchups like this one between Atalanta and Inter Milan and considering things like goal difference and whether or not a match will go into extra time, bettors can put themselves in a much better position to make money betting on soccer.

#  Result Means Atalanta Would Have Won With A Plus 

A study by statistician Nicola Paloscia has found that Atalanta would have won the Serie A title with a points tally of 83 if goal difference was a factor.

Atalanta finished fifth in the league last season, four points behind fourth-placed Lazio and Champions League qualification. However, if goal difference was taken into account, Atalanta would have leapfrogged their rivals with a total of 83 points – one more than Lazio. Juventus were crowned champions with 91 points.

“If we consider only the League table, then Atalanta finished in 5th place but they would have been first using Goal Difference as the tiebreaker criterion. In other words, it can be said that without this criterion, Gian Piero Gasperini’s team would have won its first Scudetto”, Paloscia said in an interview with Radio Anch’io Sport.

The statistician’s findings will come as a bitter blow to Atalanta fans who were so close to Champions League qualification last season. However, they will take some solace from the fact that their side exceeded all expectations by finishing as high up the table as they did.

#  Dramatic End To Game Means Bettors Win Either Way 

The final minutes of yesterday’s game between the Golden State Warriors and Oklahoma City Thunder produced some of the most intense, dramatic basketball you will ever see. The Warriors were up by three points with just over 10 seconds left on the clock, when Andre Roberson attempted a three pointer that would have tied the game. The ball bounced off the rim and back to Roberson who caught it and put up another shot, this time successfully, as the crowd went wild.

This should have been a moment of sheer joy for OKC fans, but there was a problem – the clock had stopped running with about 7 seconds still left on it. The error was caught by the officials after a video review, meaning that the last 7 seconds were actually negated and the game ended with Golden State winning 108-101. This gave bettors who had placed their money on Golden State a significant win, as they would have lost if the game had ended normally.

While some people might see this as unfair, it is simply luck of the draw in sports betting. There is no way to predict which team will make a mistake in the last few minutes of a close game, so bettors who take these kinds of risks are always rolling the dice somewhat. In this case, they came up snake eyes but it could easily have gone the other way.

#  Atalanta Springs Surprise In Tight Contest

The Atalanta Springs football team, in a tight game against their perennial rivals the Centurions, pulled off an improbable victory with a last-second touchdown.

The Centurions had been dominating the game until the last few minutes, when the Atalanta Springs offense suddenly came alive. Led by quarterback Carter Rutherford, they drove down the field and scored the winning touchdown with just seconds to play.

"It was amazing," said Rutherford after the game. "We were down by 14 points but we never gave up. We knew we could win if we just kept playing our best."

The Atalanta Springs players and fans were ecstatic after the victory, which capped off an amazing comeback. It was a great win for the team and should give them plenty of momentum as they head into the playoffs.
