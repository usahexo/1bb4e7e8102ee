#  Why Do I Have to Upgrade TurboTax to Add Gambling Winnings? 

Upgrading TurboTax to add gambling winnings is a question that many taxpayers ask. The answer is not as straightforward as one might think.

There are a few things to consider when answering this question. The first is whether or not you itemize your deductions. If you do, you can claim your gambling losses as a deduction on your taxes. However, if you don't itemize your deductions, you can't claim your gambling losses.

Another thing to consider is that only personal winnings are considered taxable income. Winnings from partnerships or LLCs are not considered taxable income." Gambling income" refers to the amount of money or its value that was won or lost from certain types of gambling activities. These activities include casino games, lotteries, horse races and even playing poker for money. 

That being said, if you have any questions about whether or not your gambling winnings are taxable, it is best to speak with a tax professional. They will be able to help guide you through the process and answer any questions you may have.
