#  Turk Telekom CEO: Blackjack is the Future of our Company

Blackjack has been around for centuries, and it’s still one of the most popular casino games in the world. This is probably because blackjack is a very simple game that anyone can learn, but it also has some complex strategic elements that make it interesting for experienced players.

Turk Telekom CEO Ahmet Bekir Tan says that blackjack is the future of his company. In an interview with Bloomberg, Tan said that blackjack is a very profitable game for casinos, and he plans to use this information to make Turk Telekom more profitable.

There are several reasons why blackjack is so profitable for casinos. The first reason is that blackjack has a low house edge. This means that the casino only has a small advantage over the player, which means players have a good chance of winning.

The second reason is that blackjack offers some exciting betting opportunities. For example, players can bet on whether they will draw a blackjack, or whether the next card will be higher or lower than the first card. These types of bets offer high payouts, which tempts players to risk their money in the hopes of winning big payouts.

Finally, blackjack is a social game that people enjoy playing. This means that casinos can attract more customers by offering blackjack tables, and these customers are likely to stay at the casino longer and gamble more money.

Turkish telecommunication giant Turk Telekom AG(TTKOM) Chief Executive Officer Ahmet Bekir Tan told Bloomberg in an interview recently that Black Jack will take center stage in TTKOM’s new strategy to increase profits from its core business operations within Turkey as well as abroad stating “we believe Black Jack will continue to be one of our main sources of profit especially when you see how much revenue casinos generate from this game” Tan was quoted as saying further adding “Black Jack isn’t just a Turkish phenomenon; it’s popular all over the world so we want to tap into this market potential” 

 In 2017 alone, casinos generated almost $40 billion from Black Jack globally with around 44% coming from North America followed by Europe at 34% and Asia Pacific at 18%. Analysts say casino operators are always on the lookout for new ways to entice gamers into their venues and Black Jack still remains one of the most popular games played in brick-and-mortar establishments partly because of its low house edge –the amount casinos earn from each bet made against them-.
