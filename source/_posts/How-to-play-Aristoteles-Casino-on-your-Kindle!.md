#  Get the inside scoop on how to play Aristoteles like a pro!

When learning how to play Aristoteles like a pro, there are a few basic concepts that you need to understand. This ancient board game is all about strategy, and if you can master the right moves, you can easily outfox your opponents and come out on top!

First of all, it’s important to learn the different pieces that are available in the game. There are six different types of pieces, each with its own unique set of abilities:

* The King - The king is the most powerful piece on the board, and can move in any direction. However, it cannot cross over other pieces or leave the board.

* The Queen - The queen can move in any direction, including diagonally.

* The Bishop - The bishop can move in any direction along a straight line.

* The Rook - The rook can move in any direction along a row or column.

* The Pawn - The pawn can only move forward one space at a time, but it can capture diagonally.

* The Knight - The knight can jump over other pieces to reach its destination. It can also move in either direction L-shaped.

Once you know which pieces are available, you need to start thinking about your strategy. In Aristoteles, the objective of the game is to capture your opponent’s king. However, capturing your opponent’s pieces along the way is also beneficial, as it will limit their ability to manoeuvre around the board. Try to think ahead and plan out your moves accordingly!

If you're looking to score big at Aristoteles Casino, you've come to the right place! Our comprehensive guide will teach you everything you need to know in order to beat the house and walk away a winner.

# Getting started

To begin, it's important to understand the basic rules of the game. In Aristoteles Casino, players compete against the dealer in an effort to score as close to 21 as possible. Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and any other card is worth its number value. The aim is to accumulate as close to 21 as possible without going over – if you go over 21, you bust and lose your bet.

The player's cards are placed face down, while the dealer's cards are dealt face up. After both players have been given their cards, the dealer will turn one of their cards over – this is called the 'upcard'. The player then has the option of either taking another card (hit) or sticking with what they've got (stand). When both the player and dealer have finished drawing cards, whoever has the higher total (or is closest to 21) wins.

# Basic strategy

Now that you understand how to play, it's time learn some basic strategy. The first thing to keep in mind is that you should never take more than one card if your total is 17 or higher – this increases your chances of busting. In general, you should hit on totals of 12 or lower, and stand on totals of 13 or higher. As a general rule, always err on the side of caution and hit if you're not sure what to do – it's better to make a small mistake than lose all your chips!

# Dealer rules

It's also important to be aware of the dealer's rules. The dealer must hit on 16 or lower and stand on 17 or higher. This means that players have an advantage when the dealer has low cards showing (2s through 6s), and a disadvantage when the dealer has high cards showing (7s through Ace). Use this knowledge to your advantage by playing more aggressively when the dealer has low cards showing and playing more conservatively when the dealer has high cards showing.

# Advanced strategy

Once you've mastered the basics, it's time to move on to advanced strategy! One key thing to remember is that you should always split 8s and Aces – this gives you two chances at winning rather than just one. You should also split 2s through 7s if possible, as well as 3s and 4s. However, it's generally not advisable to split 10s or 5s. Another important thing to remember is that when you split pairs, you must double your original bet – so make sure you have enough chips before starting a hand!

#  How to play Aristoteles – The ultimate guide!

### The game

Aristoteles by designer Toni Aleo is a two-player game where each player has nine pieces on a 9×9 board. The goal is to checkmate the opponent’s king.

The game starts with an empty board, and each player has a rook, a bishop, two knights, and three pawns. Pawns can only move forward one square at a time, except for their initial move, which can be either forward or sideways. Capturing is simply moving onto the square of the enemy piece.

Rooks can move any number of squares in a straight line, as long as they aren’t blocked by other pieces. Bishops can move any number of squares in a diagonal line, as long as they aren’t blocked. Knights move like rooks but can also jump over other pieces (provided there’s an empty square on the other side). Kings can move one square in any direction.

### How to win?

To win the game, you have to checkmate your opponent’s king. That means putting your king in a position where your opponent can’t get out of check; for example, by putting it between two of your opponent’s pieces so that they could both capture it on the next turn. If your opponent can get out of check, then you lose!

### Starting position




















And so the game begins! In this example, black moves first. Black’s king is already in check (positioned between the white rook and knight), so black has to do something about it. The most natural move would be to bring the black queen over to block the white rook (moving 1 space diagonally), but that would just give white another check with the bishop (moving 2 spaces diagonally). Black cannot take either of those checks without being put into even more trouble, so what else can black do?
