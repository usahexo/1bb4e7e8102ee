#  You Can Play Casino 777 Strip Poker on Your Smartphone!

Casino 777 Strip Poker is one of the most popular casino card games in the world. The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards and is quite easy to learn. The goal of the game is to remove all of the cards from your hand by either discarding them one at a time or playing them in combinations.

The basic rules are as follows:

After dealing each player five cards, the player to the left of the dealer starts the first turn. On a player's turn they draw one card from the deck and can either keep it or discard it. If they keep it, they must place it face-up on the table in front of them. If they discard it, they put it face-down in a pile next to them. If at any point they have no more cards left to draw (e.g., their hand has been exhausted), then they must end their turn.

After all players have had a turn, the player who discarded the last card starts another turn, and this process continues until one player either has no cards left or all of their cards have been played. At this point, that player is said to have "won" and the opponent(s) must give them all of their cards. The first player to lose all their cards (or with no cards remaining if there are only two players) automatically loses the game.

There are several variations of Casino 777 Strip Poker that can be played, but here are some basic tips for beginners:

1) In order to win a combination, all of the individual cards in that combination must be consecutive (e.g., 2 3 4 5 is not a valid combination). Aces can be either high (A K Q J 10) or low (2 3 4 5 6).

2) There are several types of winning combinations: three-of-a-kind, straight flush, four-of-a-kind, full house, flush and straight. A four-of-a-kind always beats a three-of-a-kind, a flush always beats a straight, and a full house always beats two pair. If two players have equal hands, then the higher rank card wins (Ace high beats 2 high etc.).

3) Some players like to keep track of which type of card combinations they have already used (e.g., two pairs or three-of-a kind), as this can help when trying to form new combinations. However others find this approach too complex and prefer just to discard any unused cards as soon as possible!
