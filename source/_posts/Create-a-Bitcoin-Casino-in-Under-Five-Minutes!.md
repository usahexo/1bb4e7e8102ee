#  Create a Fun and Exciting Bitcoin Casino Game Today!

Anyone can create a bitcoin casino game today with a little bit of creativity and programming know-how. In this article, we will show you how to create a basic bitcoin casino game that is both fun and exciting to play.

To get started, you will need to create a new file and name it "game.js". This file will contain all of the code necessary to run your bitcoin casino game. Next, you will need to require the "express" and "poker-engine" modules:

var express = require ( ' express ' );
var pokerEngine = require ( ' poker-engine ' );

Next, you will need to create a new Express app and initialize it with port 3000:

var app = express ();
app . listen ( 3000 , function (){ console . log ( ' Bitcoin Casino Game running at http://localhost:3000/ ' ); });

Next, you will need to create a new route for your game. This route should be accessible at "/game". The route should accept two parameters: "name" and "betAmount". The "name" parameter will be used to display the player's name in the game, while the "betAmount" parameter will be used to determine the size of the player's bet:

app . get ( ' /game ' , function ( req , res ){
res . render ( ' game ' , {

 name : req . params . name ,

 betAmount : req . params . betAmount });

});

Now, you will need to write the code for your bitcoin casino game. The first thing you will need to do is create a new PokerEngine instance and assign it to the "pokerEngine" variable:
var pokerEngine = new PokerEngine ();
Next, you will need to define the following functions:

– "deal": This function will deal two cards face down to each player in the hand. It should also print out the hands of each player:

function deal ( hands ){

 for ( var i = 0 ; i < hands . length ; i ++ ){ 

 players [i]. hand = hands[i]; 

 console . log (players[i]. hand ); 

} 

} // end of deal() function.
