#  California, Texas, and Florida Lose Out on Tax Free Bingo

As of October 1, 2019, tax-free bingo is no longer available in California, Texas, or Florida. This change was made as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which limited the availability of state and local tax deductions. The Act specifically prohibited taxpayers from deducting any amount paid or incurred for bingo games.

Bingo has been around since the 1500s, when it was used to raise money for religious ceremonies. In the early 20th century, it became popular as a way to raise money for social causes. Today, it is often used to raise money for charity events.

Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, taxpayers could deduct up to $100 per game of bingo played in a charitable event. This deduction was available regardless of whether the taxpayer won or lost money playing bingo. As a result of the Act, taxpayers can no longer deduct any amount paid or incurred for bingo games.

The changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 are estimated to raise $2 billion over 10 years.

#  California's Loss of Tax-Free Bingo Could Mean Millions in Revenue

A recent proposal in the state of California to tax bingo games could mean lost revenue for the state. According to a study by the California Legislative Analyst's Office, taxing bingo games could bring in as much as $10 million in additional revenue for the state each year.

Currently, bingo games are exempt from state and local taxes, but Assembly Bill 298 would change that. The bill was introduced by Assemblyman Richard Bloom (D-Santa Monica) in February and is currently making its way through the legislature.

If passed, the bill would impose a tax of 10 percent on all winnings from bingo games. The money raised would be used to support arts and cultural programs in California.

Opponents of the bill say it will lead to less participation in bingo games and result in less revenue for the state. They argue that the people who play bingo are predominantly seniors and that they can't afford to pay an additional 10 percent on their winnings.

Supporters of the bill say that even if there is a decrease in participation, the tax would still generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state each year. They argue that it's time to reevaluate how gambling is taxed in California and that the money raised could be used to support important programs like arts and culture.

The fate of Assembly Bill 298 is still undecided, but the debate over whether or not to tax bingo games is sure to continue.

#  Texas Loses $100 Million a Year in Tax-Free Bingo Revenue

Texas is missing out on an estimated $100 million in tax revenue each year from bingo halls, according to a new report from the state comptroller’s office.

The state currently does not tax any type of bingo game, whether it is played in a hall or online. In the fiscal year 2017, the comptroller’s office estimates that Texas lost out on more than $100 million in revenue from bingo games.

That number is only expected to grow as online bingo becomes more popular. In states like New York and Illinois, online bingo generates millions of dollars in tax revenue each year.

“This is money that we are not collecting for education, health care and other important services,” said State Comptroller Glenn Hegar. “It is long past time for the state of Texas to start taxing this activity.”

Hegar has proposed legislation that would levy a flat tax of 10 percent on all bingo winnings, regardless of the game’s format. The proposal has been approved by the Joint Committee on Revenue and sent to the full Texas Senate for consideration.

Opponents of the bill say it could hurt mom-and-pop bingo halls around the state. Hegar says he is open to tweaking the bill to help those halls, but he believes they can still compete if they offer better promotions and amenities.

Even with Hegar’s proposed tax increase, Texas would still have one of the lowest tax rates on bingo in the country.

#  Florida Loses Over $300 Million in Revenue from Tax-Free Bingo

The state of Florida has lost an estimated $301.5 million in revenue from tax-free bingo during the past five years, according to a recent study by the Florida Legislature’s Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA). OPPAGA found that, while other forms of gambling are taxed at a rate of 35 percent, bingo is exempt from state and local taxes.

The study also found that the amount of money wagered on bingo has increased significantly in recent years, from $559.7 million in fiscal year 2013-14 to $674.1 million in fiscal year 2016-17. Despite this increase, the state has seen a corresponding decrease in revenue generated from bingo taxes, which totaled just $2.8 million during fiscal year 2016-17.

State Representative Cord Byrd (R-Jacksonville) recently filed a bill that would tax bingo at 5 percent, which he estimates would generate an additional $3 million in revenue annually. “It’s time for Florida to get its fair share from this growing industry,” said Rep. Byrd. “Bingo is a big business in our state and it’s time we start treating it like one.”

Opponents of the bill argue that it would hurt smaller charities that rely on bingo proceeds to support their activities. However, Rep. Byrd notes that his bill includes a provision that would allow smaller charities to continue to operate tax-free provided they meet certain requirements.

If approved, Rep. Byrd’s bill would mark the first time that bingo has been taxed in Florida since it was made exempt from taxes in 1978.

#  States Without Tax-Free Bingo Left at a Disadvantage

Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Oklahoma are the only states without tax-free bingo halls. This places these states at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting tourists and generating revenue.

Bingo is a popular game enjoyed by people of all ages and income levels. It is enjoyed for its social aspects as well as the opportunity to win money. In order to attract tourists and generate revenue, many states offer tax-free bingo. This means that the players do not have to pay any taxes on their winnings.

The states without tax-free bingo are at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting tourists and generating revenue. Tax-free bingo halls offer an opportunity for players to enjoy the game and potentially win money without having to pay taxes. This can be a draw for tourists who are looking for ways to save money on their vacation. Additionally, tax-free bingo can help generate revenue for the state by bringing in players who would not normally visit the state.

States without tax-free bingo should consider implementing this policy in order to attract tourists and generate revenue. Offering tax-free bingo can help these states compete with others in terms of tourism and revenue generation.
